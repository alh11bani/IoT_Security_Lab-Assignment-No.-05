IoT Security Lab – Data Encryption & Device Lifecycle  
🧩 Description
This project implements two core IoT security simulations:

1️⃣ **IoT Data Encryption (Part I)**  
   Simulates how an IoT sensor device secures its temperature and humidity data before transmission using lightweight AES encryption.  
   The simulation includes:  
   - Generating random sensor readings  
   - JSON data formatting  
   - AES-128 encryption using PyCryptodome  
   - Simulated transmission  
   - Decryption on the receiver side  

2️⃣ **IoT Device Security Lifecycle (Part II)**  
   Demonstrates the 5 main lifecycle stages of an embedded IoT device, including:  
   - Threat modeling  
   - Secure boot verification  
   - Secure key injection (mock key)  
   - OTA firmware update check  
   - Secure decommissioning with key wiping  

Both tasks were implemented and tested in Google Colab as required.

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Google Colab  
- PyCryptodome (for AES encryption)  

📄 Files Included
- **IoT_Security_<YourName>_<ID>.ipynb** — main Colab notebook containing both Part I and Part II.
